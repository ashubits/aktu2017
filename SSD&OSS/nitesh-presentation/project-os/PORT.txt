Allow Specific Port Ranges
tcp		6000:6007
udp		6000:6007

**Allow access from a trusted IP address**
Typically, you would need to allow access only to publicly open ports such as port 80. Access to all other ports need to be restricted or limited. You can whitelist your home/office IP address (preferably, it is supposed to be a static IP) to be able to access your server through SSH or FTP.

sudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.1 to any port 22

Let's also allow access to the MySQL port.

sudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.1 to any port 3306
