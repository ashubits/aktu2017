Algorithm:
1. Extracting the .apk files of benign and malware folder.
2. Extracting the permissions of AndroidManifest.xml of apk files extracted in step 1.
   Name the files as Output.txt for benign folder and MalwareOutput.txt for Malware folder.
3. Sort and remove the duplicate entries of Output.txt file and save it as SortedOutput.txt file.
4. Sort and remove the duplicate entries of MalwareOutput.txt file and save it as SortedMalwareOutput.txt.
5. Compare the two sorted and unique entries files created in step 3 and 4, i.e., SortedOutput.txt and SortedMalwareOutput.txt.
   Rule of Comparison: entries present in malware file but not in benign file.

Commands used for the execution of above steps:

//for decompiling .apk files in benign folder
find . -name "*.apk" | while read filename; do java -jar apktool.jar d "$filename"; done;

//for decompiling apk folders given in malware folder
find . -name "*" | while read filename; do java -jar apktool.jar d "$filename"; done;

//for finding permissions given in AndroidManifest.xml file of all apk files of benign folder
find . -name "*.xml" | while read filename; do grep -r permission "$filename" >> Output.txt; done;

//for finding permissions given in AndroidManifest.xml file of all apk files of Malware folder
find . -name "*.xml" | while read filename; do grep -r permission "$filename" >> MalwareOutput.txt; done;

//Unique sort Output.txt (this will sort the file as well as remove the duplicate entries in the file)
sort -u Output.txt >> SortedOutput.txt

//Unique sort MalwareOutput.txt
sort -u MalwareOutput.txt >> SortedMalwareOutput.txt

//Compare the two sorted and unique entries output file
comm -1 -3 SortedOutput.txt SortedMalwareOutput.txt >> Difference.txt

-1 in above command will suppress the entries present in SortedOutput.txt(which belongs to benign), -3 in above command will suppress the entries common to both the files. Hence the output will be the Malware Permissions.
